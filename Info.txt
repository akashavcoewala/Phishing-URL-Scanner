# Phishing URL Scanner - Project Documentation

## 1. Introduction
Phishing attacks are a significant threat in cybersecurity, tricking users into revealing sensitive information. This project aims to build a **Phishing URL Scanner** that detects suspicious URLs using various techniques.

## 2. Project Overview
- **Project Name:** Phishing URL Scanner
- **Technology Used:** Python, Machine Learning (optional), APIs, Regular Expressions, CSV Handling
- **Goal:** To detect and classify URLs as phishing or legitimate
- **Output:** A report indicating whether a given URL is phishing or safe

## 3. Working of the Project
### Step 1: Data Input
- The program takes a list of URLs from a file or user input.

### Step 2: Feature Extraction
- It checks for common phishing characteristics:
  - Presence of suspicious keywords (e.g., "login", "verify", "update")
  - Use of IP addresses instead of domain names
  - Long or obfuscated URLs
  - Special characters in URL (like @, -, etc.)

### Step 3: External API Validation
- It uses **VirusTotal API** or **Google Safe Browsing API** to check URL reputation.

### Step 4: Result Generation
- If a URL is found malicious, it is flagged as phishing.
- Results are stored in `scan_results.csv`.

## 4. Key Components in the Code
### **phishing_scanner.py**
- Reads URLs from `urls.txt`
- Extracts features
- Uses an API to check URL reputation
- Saves results to `scan_results.csv`

### **scan_results.csv**
- Stores the classification results.

### **urls.txt**
- Contains the list of URLs to be scanned.

## 5. Deployment
- Clone the repository from GitHub
- Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run `python phishing_scanner.py`
- Upload additional URLs in `urls.txt` for scanning

## 6. Common Interview Questions
### **Coding Questions:**
1. How does your script extract suspicious patterns from a URL?
2. How do you handle API rate limits in VirusTotal?
3. How do you store and retrieve scan results?
4. How can you improve the accuracy of phishing detection?

### **Theory Questions:**
1. What are phishing attacks and how do they work?
2. What techniques can be used to detect phishing URLs?
3. How does VirusTotal or Google Safe Browsing API work?
4. What are the challenges in phishing detection?

## 7. Future Enhancements
- Implement machine learning-based classification
- Develop a web-based interface for scanning
- Improve accuracy using advanced heuristics

## 8. Conclusion
This Phishing URL Scanner helps users identify malicious URLs efficiently using predefined patterns and external APIs. It provides a robust foundation for further enhancements in cybersecurity detection tools.
